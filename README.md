# Madness

Fast paced, addictive, make you mad kind of game.

This is a proof of concept browser version of Madness based off the original Windows desktop version I developed as a kid. You can find the original for Windows here: [Madness](https://justinpaulhammond.com/silverwolfgames/madness.php).

## Install

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Usage

Use the `left and right arrow keys` to control the ball. Avoid getting hit by the blocks and see how long you can survive! Watch out, as time goes on, more blocks will fall and their speed will increase. Can you reach Madness?

Press `escape` to go back to the menu.

## TODO

- Create playable space all objects must remain in (in-progress)
- JS must be enabled warning
- High score DB
- Make movement fluid and not in chunks of pixels at a time
- Delete blocks that move off the screen
- Convert to React
- Linting/Testing
